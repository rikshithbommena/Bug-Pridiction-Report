# Ensemble Insights: Revolutionizing Bug Prediction in Software Development.

### 📌 Project Aim
To develop an ensemble machine learning model that accurately predicts software bugs before they occur, improving code quality and reducing development time and maintenance cost.

### 📝 Description
India, being a global hub for software development, encounters major challenges in software quality assurance. Traditional bug prediction methods like manual reviews, static analysis, and extensive test cycles are often slow, error-prone, and inefficient.

This project focuses on using machine learning to automate bug prediction, reducing manual effort and integrating predictive intelligence into modern development workflows like CI/CD pipelines. The system leverages historical code data and bug patterns to train models that can detect bugs in advance, boosting productivity and software reliability.

### 🧠 Problem Statement
Manual bug detection methods are:

Time-consuming

Prone to human error

Inefficient with growing code complexity

Solution: Use machine learning algorithms to automate bug prediction and integrate it into the development cycle.
