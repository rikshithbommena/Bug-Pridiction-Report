State machine diagram with duplicated transitions

After moving the ComputerSystem sample model from Papyrus-RT 0.7.2 to the Neon stream I get duplicated transition shown in the newly created UML-RT State Machine Diagram (see attachment).

I can remove them from the diagram (after making the diagram unsynchronized) in which case the diagram is fine but closing and opening Eclipse brings back the diagram with duplications.

I took the following steps when upgrading the diagram to Neon:

1) Imported (with copy) the model into a new workspace
2) Opened the model updated the profile.
3) Created a new UML-RT Capsule Diagram for each capsule cleaned up the diagram and removed the old composite structure diagram.
4) Created a new UML-RT State Machine Diagram for each state machine and cleaned up the diagram. Note that at this point no duplicates are shown.
5) Closed and re-opened Eclipse
6) duplicated transitions are found.
7) Note that removing the new ones (i.e. the ones that do not look correct e.g. not rectilinear) results in in the same scenario as see from step 5. Removing he old one (i.e. the one cleaned up in step 4) results in both the transition and its shadow being removed.",ansgar.radermacher,charles,fixed,1,closed,6,2017-03-21,0,31,2017-01-20,231,normal,2
CDT-155878,2006-08-31,cdt-core,CDT,CDT needs to know the exact architecture it's running on not what the JVM thinks it is,"There are a number of places in the CDT where org.eclipse.core.runtime.Platform.getOSArch() is called to find out what the machine architecture is so that it can determine if for example gdb can debug a particular executable.

On most platforms so far just calling getOSArch has worked fine because typically people run a 64-bit Eclipse + JVM when running on x86_64 and a 32-bit Eclipse when running on x86.

However there is a different situation on PowerPC where many of the newer machines are 64-bit but there is only one 32-bit Eclipse built for PowerPC.  So when the CDT call getOSArch on PowerPC it always returns ppc regardless of whether or not the machine is actually ppc64.

At first I proposed a change to org.eclipse.core.runtime.Platform.getOSArch() so that it would return a more accurate OS architecture value... in the PowerPC case ppc64 (when appropriate of course).

However this idea was rejected by the Eclipse core team because they want that value to reflect what the osgi layer says the machine is.

My new proposal is to introduce a new class in org.eclipse.cdt.utils called Platform.  It will mimic what the org.eclipse.core.runtime.Platform class does except that it will return a more accurate value for getOSArch().

I will attach a proposed org.eclipse.cdt.utils.Platform implementation.",cdt-core-inbox,cjashfor,fixed,1,resolved,4,2007-06-22,0,3,2007-06-22,295,normal,2
