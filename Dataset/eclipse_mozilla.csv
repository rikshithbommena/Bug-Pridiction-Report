State machine diagram with duplicated transitions

After moving the ComputerSystem sample model from Papyrus-RT 0.7.2 to the Neon stream I get duplicated transition shown in the newly created UML-RT State Machine Diagram (see attachment).

I can remove them from the diagram (after making the diagram unsynchronized) in which case the diagram is fine but closing and opening Eclipse brings back the diagram with duplications.

I took the following steps when upgrading the diagram to Neon:

1) Imported (with copy) the model into a new workspace
2) Opened the model updated the profile.
3) Created a new UML-RT Capsule Diagram for each capsule cleaned up the diagram and removed the old composite structure diagram.
4) Created a new UML-RT State Machine Diagram for each state machine and cleaned up the diagram. Note that at this point no duplicates are shown.
5) Closed and re-opened Eclipse
6) duplicated transitions are found.
7) Note that removing the new ones (i.e. the ones that do not look correct e.g. not rectilinear) results in in the same scenario as see from step 5. Removing he old one (i.e. the one cleaned up in step 4) results in both the transition and its shadow being removed.",ansgar.radermacher,charles,fixed,1,closed,6,2017-03-21,0,31,2017-01-20,231,normal,2
CDT-155878,2006-08-31,cdt-core,CDT,CDT needs to know the exact architecture it's running on not what the JVM thinks it is,"There are a number of places in the CDT where org.eclipse.core.runtime.Platform.getOSArch() is called to find out what the machine architecture is so that it can determine if for example gdb can debug a particular executable.

On most platforms so far just calling getOSArch has worked fine because typically people run a 64-bit Eclipse + JVM when running on x86_64 and a 32-bit Eclipse when running on x86.

However there is a different situation on PowerPC where many of the newer machines are 64-bit but there is only one 32-bit Eclipse built for PowerPC.  So when the CDT call getOSArch on PowerPC it always returns ppc regardless of whether or not the machine is actually ppc64.

At first I proposed a change to org.eclipse.core.runtime.Platform.getOSArch() so that it would return a more accurate OS architecture value... in the PowerPC case ppc64 (when appropriate of course).

However this idea was rejected by the Eclipse core team because they want that value to reflect what the osgi layer says the machine is.

My new proposal is to introduce a new class in org.eclipse.cdt.utils called Platform.  It will mimic what the org.eclipse.core.runtime.Platform class does except that it will return a more accurate value for getOSArch().

I will attach a proposed org.eclipse.cdt.utils.Platform implementation.",cdt-core-inbox,cjashfor,fixed,1,resolved,4,2007-06-22,0,3,2007-06-22,295,normal,2

CDT-239464,2008-07-03,cdt-core,CDT,Rebuild of index on project import,"Build ID: M20080221-1800

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Create a project using a project directory external to the workspace. Choose a project large enough to be able to notice that the index is being rebuilt.
2. Build the Index
3. Export the team-shared index (to the default location)
4. Delete the project
5. Import the project (Import->General->Existing Projects into workspace)
Note that the index is completely rebuilt


More information:
If the cdt debug messages are turned on you can see that the exported index is used and an update-index operation is performed (with no activity) and then a complete rebuild is also done.

If the sequence above is slightly modified so that after deleting the project from the workspace you exit eclipse and then restart eclipse and then do the import then the index is not rebuilt.

It seems like something is being left over that should be removed by the delete. I thought I found it once but I can't find it again. I think fFiletoProject or fUpdatePolicies in the workspace may still have an entry for the project even after it is deleted but it was never referenced on the import so it doesn't seem like that could cause a problem.

This scenario is convenient for testing but is not something a user is likely to do.",mschorn.eclipse,john.pruitt,fixed,1,resolved,4,2008-07-08,0,2,2008-07-08,5,normal,2

4. The tooltip of the Profile button on the toolbar has now changed

You will notice that nothing happens. This is because this configuration is 
dependent on attaching to a Java process. But since you've killed that process 
this configuration can't attach to anything so it does nothing.

TMF-282086,2009-06-30,Xtext,TMF,Underline error - underline of already solved error is still visible.,"Sometimes when there had been an syntax error in grammar(after the place of editing) but it was corrected(by a change before ocurence error) and code has no errors - there is still red underline that did not disappeared. The code is correct it can be saved edited in some other places but the underline stays. 
There can be many errors like that in editor.

How to reproduce underline error.

I am using xtext sample project org.xtext.example.mydsl without any changes. Itemis distro is used so that infer ANTLR.

Create sample project run workflow run Eclipse instance.
Create mydsl:


type String
type Int

entity One
	
}

entity Two{

} 


code has error on line 6 as '{' is missing. 
So we can add '{':


type String
type Int

entity One{
	
}

entity Two{

} 


 then there is no error in grammar but the '}' is still underlined.

I can change code before and after entity One and the underline is still there:


type String
type Int
type NewType

entity OneOneOneOneOne{
	
}

entity Two{
 property Prop :OneOneOneOneOne
} 


If I change something inside entity One(after '{' and before '}') then the underline disappear. 

One can create another underline error by inserting and then removing '{' after 'property Prop :OneOneOneOneOne'.",clay,kowalczyk.krzysztof,fixed,1,closed,6,2017-09-19,0,9,2009-07-23,23,minor,2

GMF-RUNTIME-248026,2008-09-19,General,GMF-RUNTIME,Memory leak in SetConnectionEndsCommand,"Created attachment 113050
SetConnectionEndsCommand

Build ID: GMF 1.1.0_v20080425

Steps To Reproduce:
After executing a SetConnectionEndsCommand (obtained for example from a request) the DefaultOperationHistory can hold onto these commands.  These commands in turn hold onto the adaptables which could be edit parts containing other edit parts.  Simply setting these adaptables to null after executing the command frees up a lot of memory.  A patch to fix the problem is attached.

PLATFORM-66451,2004-06-09,Releng,PLATFORM,[RCP] RCP SDK and Runtime packages should include update configurator,"[See related bugs: bug 58040 bug 59422 bug 60306 bug 62316 bug 64290 bug 
65722]
RCP developers are confused by the configurator not being included in the base 
RCP so I believe it should be included. The arguments that I've seen so far 
against including it and my counter-arguments are below.

Argument 1: You can have an RCP application without a configurator (by listing 
all the plug-ins manually) and the RCP package is supposed to be the bare 
minimum.
Answer: Listing plug-ins manually is a tedious and error-prone process and it 
breaks the powerful and intuitive idea of being able to add a plug-in or set 
of plug-ins to an existing application and have Eclipse discover the addition.

Argument 2: An RCP application may want to provide their own configurator.
Answer: They might but it's unlikely. The regular Eclipse one is fine for 99% 
of the cases.

Argument 3: It would add to the download size.
Answer: Ok but we're only talking about 100K or less in a 5M download.

Argument 4: You can get around the PDE Self-hosting launch error about the 
missing configurator by making a change to the target workspace options.
Answer: Yes but that's completely non-obvious. I didn't know about it until I 
found a bug report where the method was explained.

I think the pros and cons come down to a purist view vs. a practical one. It's 
true that the update configurator was not originally intended to be part of 
the base RCP and strictly speaking it is optional. But it's so darned useful 
that we should recommend every RCP application include it and make that the 
easiest and best supported use case. Besides if it is not included as you can 
see already you're asking for a steady stream of questions about why plug-ins 
don't work they way people are used to in the full Eclipse.",platform-releng-inbox,ed.burnette,fixed,1,resolved,4,2005-04-22,0,21,2005-04-21,316,normal,2

EEF-371803,2012-02-16,General,EEF,emft-eef b3aggrcon file appears wrong,"Things might be working but I think the emft-eef file is set up wrong and is at best confusing at at worst indeterminate. 

This came up during some final Indigo SR2 rebuilds where it was discovered there are two repositories mentioned in the contribution file each contributing same feature and it turns out each of them contributes features to the category of modeling. 

In fact there are five features! contributed by emft-eef in the modeling category: 

    
    

   

    
    

So confusing at best. 

So not sure how this impact Indigo (if at all) but should be fixed for Juno if same pattern is there. 

Another odd thing is specifying version ranges for the two features as 

versionRange=[1.0.01.1.0]

I think this means any version in that range is satisfactory and I am not sure if you will always get the highest version in that range which is probably want you intend. I mean you probably will most of the time ... but if some other feature said is needed [1.0.0 1.0.5) then you would get version 1.0.4 instead of your intended 1.0.8 ... I'm just making up numbers for example. 

It is best to specify the exact version you want or to specify a very specific repository that only has one version in it.",emft.eef-inbox,david_williams,fixed,1,resolved,4,2016-05-05,0,4,2012-03-08,21,normal,2

CDT-73583,2004-09-09,cdt-core,CDT,[Refactoring] Refactor fails if indexer errors exist.,"Turn on C/C++ preferences: Follow #includes when producing the outline view.
(Close & reopen project if toggling this after project has been built.)

Create a mgd static library project with Foo.h:
namespace B {
  class Foo {
	public:
		Foo() {}
		~Foo() {}
		void refactorMe()
		void go()
  }
}
and Foo.cpp:
#include Foo.h
#include 
using namespace std
using namespace B
void Foo::refactorMe()	{}
void Foo::go() 
{
	time_t now
	cout << Start:  << endl
	refactorMe()
	now=time(NULL)
	cout << End:  << ctime(
}
Check all the indexer error markers in the project properties.
Build.
Open Foo.h. Select refactorMe in the outline view and rename to boo.
The problem is Foo.h gets refactored but not Foo.cpp so compilation will fail.
There is a warning message (see attached) IF you chose to preview before doing
the actual factor not like the in-your-face error dialog if you refactor the
method in Foo.cpp: This refactor cannot be performed correctly due to syntax
errors in the translation unit. To perform this operation you need to fix the
errors. You can get rid of the indexer errors by putting std:: in front of
time_t and ctime or turn off the follow #includes preference & close & reopen
project. 

With a large project with many dependencies on a .h file you wish to refactor
this can get tedious especially if you want to keep the follow #includes option
for your outline view or class browser. It would be better to have refactor rely
on quickparse rather than structural parse so that it won't crap out on an
indexer error. There are no compilation errors so refactor should work.",mschorn.eclipse,twolff,fixed,1,resolved,4,2009-01-09,0,3,2005-06-02,266,major,4

Because the version of Lucene which with these indexes are created (1.9.1) does not match the runtime version (2.9.1) the prebuilt indexes are ignored: the search index will be created from scratch instead of merging the prebuilt indexes.

Due to the speed-up by Lucene 2.9.1 on my laptop the first query takes about 7 seconds without (or with wrong) prebuilt indexes to create the search index from scratch – not much more than the 3 or 4 seconds with the correct 2.9.1 indexes.

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Generate an initial Xtext project via New Project -> Xtext project generate the sources by executing the Xtext MWE workflow

2. Replace the extension of the extension point org.eclipse.emf.ecore.extension_parser by the extension point org.eclipse.emf.ecore.content_parser

3. Define a new content type by extending the extension point org.eclipse.core.contenttype.contentTypes and let the extension of step 2 use it

4. Start a new IDE and try to manage a model file with the extension defined in the contentTypes extension point

-> Result: in the XtextDocument method setInput the statement
aResource = resourceSet.createResource(uri) (line 99)
returns the generic registered resource factory XmiResourceFactory instead of the XtextResourceFactory although the latter one was registered.


More information:
For more details see the following plugin.xml file part:

    
        <parser
            class=com.mm.mmdsl1.MmDsl1ExecutableExtensionFactory:org.eclipse.xtext.resource.XtextResourceFactory
            contentTypeIdentifier=com.mm.mmdsl>

            name=MmDsl
            priority=high>
        
    

The following code snippet in XtextDocument would be aware of the in this way registered resource factory

replace the line

aResource = resourceSet.createResource(uri)

by

Resource.Factory resourceFactory = getResourceFactoryRegistry().getFactory(uri)
aResource = resourceFactory.createResource(uri)

Note: 

The content of two profiling files that you will need to reproduce this defect 
is attached (at the end) as part of this message.  The SimpleClient makes two 
method calls: clientDummyMethod (this is a local call) and clientMethod (this 
is a remote call).  The SimpleServer has only one method entry and exit with an 
invocation context that corresponds to clientMethod under SimpleClient.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steps to reproduce:

1) Import SimpleClient.xml (Specify a monitor name that is not being used)
2) Import SimpleServer.xml (Use the same monitor name as (1) )
3) Open the UML - Class Interaction view
Notice that the UML diagram of the first agent and the second agent are correct
4) Make sure that the monitor (and the host) is visible in the profiling 
monitor view
5) Highlight the monitor of the two hosts representing the client and the server

Notice that the UML (class interaction) diagram is incorrect.  The clientMethod 
is entered and existed without being correlated with the Server class.  There 
is a second block created on the 'Client' string that is correlated with a 
block under the 'Server' string.  There shouldn't be a gap between the two 
blocks displayed on the 'Client' string and the clientMethod should exit after 
it returns from the 'Server' string.

6) Open the UML diagram view of thread interaction.

This UML diagram gives the impression that clientDummy is the remote method 
being called.  It should be the clientMethod instead. 

Similar UML diagrams display the wrong correlation too.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create the following Xtend class:

class X1 {
  def op() {
    var mt1 = new MyType()
    val mt2 = -mt1 
    val mt3 = !mt1
  }
}

and the following Java class:

public class MyType {
  public MyType operator_minus() { return null	}
  public MyType operator_not() { return null }
}

2. The two XEpression:s '-mt1' and '!mt1' will be marked with error 'Invalid number of arguments. Expected ()' in the Xtend editor.

3. Modifying MyType as follows:

public class MyType {
  public MyType operator_minus() { return null }
  public MyType operator_not() { return null }
  public MyType operator_minus(MyType mt) { return null }
  public MyType operator_not(MyType mt) { return null }
}

will remove the error but will link the minus (-) and not (!) operators to the wrong methods ('operator_minus(MyType mt)' and 'operator_not(MyType mt)'). This can be seen by hovering over the unary operators in the Xtend editor. The compiler will though generate the correct code by calling operator_minus() and operator_not().",tmf.xtext-inbox,erules,fixed,1,closed,6,2017-10-31,0,3,2013-04-19,326,normal,2

I'd like to officially get this API deprecated for CDT6 as:

 - It's been entirely superceded by ICProjectDescription ICProjectDescriptionManager & ICConfigurationDescription & friends
 - It's not configuration aware 
 - It stores all data in all configurations - we can't change this without breaking existing assumptions
 - It provides raw access to the underlying XML tree which makes it difficult to be thread-safe and prevents us from storing the project data in any other way.
 - Having two APIs for the same storage functionality is confusing.

Only 2 in-CDT consumers remain - the binary parser mapping and scanner config.  It's my intention to fix this post CDT 6.

Z_ARCHIVED-95493,2005-05-17,Hyades,Z_ARCHIVED,(PLAT) Agent Controller on iSeries should enforce 1.4 JVM to run file and security servers,"On some versions of IBM iSeries operating systems multiple versions of the JDK 
are packaged together with the operating system. To select a specific version 
the JVM argument -Djava.version=nnn is used otherwise a configured default 
version is used.  The Agent Controller requires JDK 1.4 to run.  The Agent 
Controller creates a JVM to run the java file and security server but does not 
set the JDK version.  Therefore it relies on the default JVM to run these 
servers.  On iSeries Agent Controller should enforce running the file and 
security servers in a 1.4 JVM by passing the -Djava.version=1.4 argument when 
creating the JVM.

Relying on the default JVM causes problems.  The file server has been changed 
to use the java.nio.channels classes which were introduced in JDK 1.4.  If the 
default JDK on the iSeries machine is 1.3 these classes will not be found 
resulting in file server failures.  A concrete example of this problem is 
bugzilla 94284 - remote log import with filters from an iSeries machine fails.",samwai,smith,fixed,1,closed,6,2012-02-15,0,4,2005-05-18,1,major,4

TMF-366320,2011-12-11,Xtext,TMF,[Xtend] maven plugin should use target/generated-classes,"Currently the maven plugin uses src/main/xtend-gen and src/test/xtend-gen as the default directory for generated .java files during compilation.

The standard behavior for Maven is to use target/generated-sources/xxxx for generated source files.

IntelliJ IDEA and (I believe) Netbeans automatically detect these directories as source directories and use them for auto-completion and static analysis of the rest of a project.

As it's often frowned upon to generate source code into version control managed directories and it improves integration with non-eclipse development tools it would be good to change the default configuration to use the following output directories:

  
    ${project.build.directory}/generated-sources/xtend

To resolve this we should use the readBlob API instead of using the .Location property directly.

We will address that probably by exposing a specific action on .ecore files.

GMF-RUNTIME-433129,2014-04-21,General,GMF-RUNTIME,Copy and paste reduces width and height of GMF shapes,"Steps to reproduce:
1. Create GMF logic diagram.
2. Add Logic Flow Container element from palette to the diagram.
3. Enlarge the view size on diagram.
4. Copy and paste the view on the diagram.
5. New view will also be added to the diagram.
6. Save the model.
7. Now open the model in a text editor.

Expected result:
Height and width should be same for both the shapes.

Actual result:
Height and Width values will be reduced. This size differences causing issues in customer scenarios.
For example here is the sample text output:

Root cause:
In gmf class org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.diagram.ui.commands.PasteCommand it uses HiMetricMapMode to scale the width and height coordinates along with positional values. This causes the changes in the coordinates.

CDT-171245,2007-01-22,cdt-core,CDT,CDT core plugin startup is blocking the UI thread for unacceptable long time,"Build ID: I20061214-1445

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Launch Eclipse with CDT installed but with all editors closed and within the resource perspective
2. Switch to C/C++ perspective
3. The switch is blocking the UI.
4. Halt the whole system within the debugger.

- For the user the term 'working copy' is not clear it' a technical term. From technical point of view I would guess the parsed data is not persisted. Is it really necessary to provide this detail to the user?

- The context of this checkbox is not clear. What happens when it's enabled or disabled? In case it only affects the outline view it should be mentioned

JSDT-314133,2010-05-24,General,JSDT,need to remove most change a few webtools repository URL in feature.xml,"+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #303935 +++

See bug 291637 for a broader discussion. 

In Web Tools we have historically always used the following URL for our update sites: 

http://download.eclipse.org/webtools/updates/ 

But this needs to change for a few reasons. For one (if we have to change it anyway) the term updates is now inaccurate or at least old-fashioned ... it is more of a repository. 

Also because we now want repositories to persist forever it is too high level. For each major release we should have one specific to that release. Also using the version number is pretty old fashioned too and I see no reason not to use the yearly release name. such as 

http://download.eclipse.org/webtools/repository/helios


While we can (and should?) still provide

as a viable URL it is anticipated that over the years it would perform slower and slower so it would be best to normally point people to a more specific one for any particular release. 

And while not normally advertised to most users under the covers we will have separate (hierarchical) repositories for each maintenance or off-cycle release. Currently I'd prefer date-time-stamp directories for these (rather than say SR0 SR1 SR2 because then off cycle release fit in more naturally so these very specific URLs would look like 

http://download.eclipse.org/webtools/repository/helios/201006260900/

So the suggestion is that for feature update URLs the value would be 

http://download.eclipse.org/webtools/repository/helios/

We'd probably want to do this by M6 since it is UI. (That is might effect documentation screen captures or similar).

The problem is that when the validation loops inside CompositeEValidator#validate() (called by Diagnostication#validate()) and encounters an uninitialized AbstractDeclarativeValidator with an @ComposedChecks annotation then it will eventually create an instance of the validator referenced by the annotation. This is done using Guice which then also injects the EValidatorRegistrar into the register() method. This in turn then adds the new validator to the CompositeEValidator using CompositeEValidator#addValidator(). This modifies the contents field and then causes the exception in the loop of CompositeEValidator#validate().",tmf.xtext-inbox,knut.wannheden,fixed,1,closed,6,2017-09-19,0,3,2009-07-28,47,normal,2

Following a plugin-install link isn't working for me.. Although it does drive
the page to the Plugins category the 'install' param collector doesn't appear
so I can't proceed. Perhaps some recent change caused the command to not be
associated with the 'installPlugin' URI binding?

Strangely the param collector does appear if you do this:

2. Go to
/settings/settings.html#category=pluginsinstallPlugin=http://mamacdon.github.com/outliner/outlinerPlugin.html

Z_ARCHIVED-80413,2004-12-07,Hyades,Z_ARCHIVED,Generic Log Adapter docs errors/problems,"The following issues were found while reviewing the Generic Log Adapter docs:

1. In Setting up a log parser plug-in project it says you need to add 
the org.eclipse.ui plugin as a dependency. Is this really true? It shouldn't. 
Also in one of the steps it says Click Okay. Does it actually say Okay (as 
opposed to OK)?

2. Sometimes it says Rules-based and other times Rule-based. Should pick 
one and be consistent.

3. It says Copyright 2000 2004 at the bottom. I don't think the GLA existed in 
2000 or even 2001... should do a check on all the copyright dates.

4. In Configuring the adapter Contexts and Configuration the links sections 
at the bottom are all bunched together.. different than the other pages. Should 
be consistent with the other pages.

5. Some screenshots are new (post-3.0) some are old (pre-3.0) and they look 
quite different with the icons.

6. In Deploying the log parser it says I need <import 
plugin=org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility/> in my plugin.xml but that's 
only true if I need runtime compatibility with pre-eclipse-3.0 API. Normally 
you wouldn't need this. Also the screenshot shows an obvious bug in it.. the 
icons are missing and for some reason are really small.

8. In Creating a custom component the HEAD node in CVS is always shown in 
upper-case (it's Head in the docs).

9. In Creating a custom component and Testing a custom component the 
entries on the left don't match the headings in the actual content (new instead 
of custom).

10. In Migrating static parser from 1.3.0 to 3.0.0 the link to Common Base

Some Platform feature.xml files still contribute incorrect confusing update site URL's in the  tag.

the following:

From An Introduction to Profiling Java Applications
Section 3.5  Attaching to a local Java Application

I am using Linux Fecora Core 3 and j2sdk1.4.2_04

1. Change to eclipse home directory
2.   eclipse -data profile
This works opens up eclipse in preparation to profile a second workbench.

3.  java -XrunpiAgent:server=enabled -classpath %CLASSPATH%startup.jar
org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main

I am running Fedora Core 3 linux so this was changed to:
 java -XrunpiAgent:server=enabled -classpath $CLASSPATH:startup.jar
org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main

It looks like it wants to run but second eclipse never launches.

did a ps -ef | grep eclipse

devuser    3723  3499  0 12:22 pts/1    00:00:00 eclipse -data profile

Noticed what eclipse -data profile command produced from above

Did this command instead (this worked)
/home/devuser/j2sdk1.4.2_04/bin/java -XrunpiAgent:server=enabled  -cp
/home/devuser/eclipse/startup.jar org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main -os linux

-vm /home/devuser/j2sdk1.4.2_04/bin/java -vmargs -cp
/home/devuser/eclipse/startup.jar org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main

All I did is copy the output from the ps command add the
-XrunpiAgent:server=enabled part and changed the -data profile part to
-data workspacenew  (or leave it out and use default workspace provided it
is not called profile).

New workbench came up.

proposed patch

This bug-report is an excerpt from 
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=217292

The proposed patch fixed the problems with the fast machine but not the
original bug reported therefore i created this entry.

Description:

The problematic steps were that in
Java_org_eclipse_cdt_utils_spawner_Spawner_exec0 a thread for watching the
process termination was started. It seemed that this thread couldn't get the
correct handle for the process to wait for. Therefore it terminated and for the
spawner treated this as if the process couldn't be started.
The patch I attached uses the no thread for the startup check e.g. it waits
either for the waitEvent which is triggered from starter.exe and indicates
that everything went ok or for the process termination which indicates that
the starter.exe wasn't run correctly.

2nd part of the thread was to do the proper cleanup which is still handled by
the thread but it's only launched if everything started up correcly. When
passing the args to the thread procedure I noticed that some memory might get
screwed up so I explicitely handled this.",aleherb+eclipse,johann.draschwandtner,fixed,1,resolved,4,2008-09-09,0,6,2008-04-04,2,normal,2

This prevents the EEF Generate Architecture from proceeding properly.

In the case of this .ecore file the Attendances relationship on the Time_Card had no widget assigned to it.

To reproduce this situation use the .ecore file in a base project to create a .genmodel file.  Double-click the .genmodel file.  Select the top node of the .genmodel file and use the right mouse to see the context menu and select Generate All.

To the edit project add a source folder named src-gen and another folder named model.  Back in the base project use the right mouse on the .genmodel file to bring up the context menu.  Select EEF Initialize.  Specify the model directory in the edit project as the place to receive the EEF Initialize output files (.component and .eefgen).

Double the .components file in the edit project's model folder.  Expand the top node to show the Properties and the Repository.  Expand the Repository to see the Category.  Expand Category to show the Views.  Expand the Time_Card view to show the container.  Expand the container to show the Elements.

CDT-217680,2008-02-04,cdt-core,CDT,toggle source/header switches to wrong source file,"Build ID: M20070921-1145

Steps To Reproduce:
a) Create foo.h with a class with some methods in it and foo.cpp and bla.cpp where bla.cpp contains lots of implementations of methods from foo.h and foo.cpp contains few. When foo.h is open and *neither* foo.cpp nor bla.cpp are open switch source/header opens bla.cpp instead of foo.cpp.

b) Use the Qt framework. Create a simple QObject derived class in foo.h and foo.cpp with Q_OBJECT macro and only constructor and destructor and build the Qt project. The effect is that Qt's qmake generates code in a file moc_foo.cpp and since your foo.cpp only contains a few methods moc_foo.cpp is opened when switching between header and source.

More information:
Looking at the code in ToggleSourceAndHeaderAction.java it seems like a deliberate decision to first look in the abstract syntax tree for the file with most implementations and open this and the file name is only a fallback.

I strongly think that this is the wrong order the naming convention is there and is strong in the mind: All people I talked to expected toggle source/header to switch between foo.h and foo.cpp if they exist not between foo.h and bla.cpp (think that one often wants to switch to foo.cpp to *add* implementation code there...).

It also makes toggle source/header useless in many cases when using Qt (or any other tool that automatically generates parts of class implementations for you).

The mechanism to look in the AST is a great thing but only in the case where the file name convention doesn't work.",aleherb+eclipse,mail,fixed,1,resolved,4,2009-01-09,3,3,2008-02-05,1,normal,2

GMF seems to be highly dependent on Cairo graphics library
but unfortunately Cairo binaries are not available on Sun solaris platform
When I try building cairo libraries I get no of errors.
I have filed this build issue with Cairo
(https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7551)
But frankly I don't get proper solution. Instead I was asked to
build/configure my Sun machine itself.

When I did a google search I see that I am not the only person
who is having build problem with cairo on sun platform.

I simply can't not use GMF on Sun machine just because of cairo
dependency. All other features/dependencies of GMF are well in place.

So I suggest that GMF should remove this cairo dependency and instead look
for other alternative graphics library.
I raised this issue in newsgroup as well but didn't get any response.
Pl suggest me any solution/workaround.

I am using GMF 1.0RC5 with Eclipse3.2R7.

databases which have case sensitivity turned on by default we are finding that

the field will solve this problem.  I didn't see any specific options in the
entity generator for this (it does have an option to generate extra annotations

#  Copyright

I'm not sure if this change is intended -- in the past the Fix Copyrights action only touched the one single line where it replaced the year. Now it touches the entire Copyright header which is problematic in two ways:

(1) Unnecessary diffs in CVS
(2) Tools for file scanning / search+replace which used to match against the
    entire verbatim Copyright header cannot do so any more because there are
    now two variants of the Copyright header (with 1 space if not touched by
    the 3.5m7 tool or with 2 spaces if touched by it).

to me it seems like there is an error in the The Grammar Language example.

I am currently just learning to use xtext but this doesn't seem right to me and is confusing might also just be me not understanding. Maybe you could clarify or change this.

The events are declared as follows:

events
  doorClosed  D1CL
  drawOpened  D2OP
  lightOn     L1ON
  doorOpened  D1OP
  panelClosed PNCL
  resetting doorOpened D1OP
end

Note the resetting line.

But the later grammar definition just declares the following terminmals

Statemachine :
  'events'
     (events+=Event)+
  'end'
  ('resetEvents'
     (resetEvents+=[Event])+
  'end')?
  'commands'
     (commands+=Command)+
  'end'
  (states+=State)+

Here resetEvents is declared as separate begin/end block instead of as part of 'events'.

In addition to that neither resetting or resetEvents is used or mentioned again. Could you maybe clarify it like saying it is not used or add an example how to handle it?

JSDT-253166,2008-11-03,General,JSDT,Javascript validation has several errors with correct code,"Some of our javascript-files yield parse-errors with the (default installed) javascript validation in Eclipse Ganymede. This was in a PDT-2.0 project with the Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers-edition of Ganymede enhanced with the latest DLTK Core Frameworks 1.0 Integration build and WTP 3.0.2

Some of the errors are in code like this:

var preloadImages = {}
function preload(label url overwrite)

	if (overwrite || !(label in preloadImages))
// The error: The operator in is undefined for the argument type(s) any ___anonymous866_867

// The error: Image cannot be resolved to a type
// It also doesn't know about 'Option'

There are several other errors in that file of which most aren't errors according to the major browsers. Enabling the Firefox-library for that project doesn't help adjusting any of the settings seems to be useless.

PLATFORM-125250,2006-01-25,Releng,PLATFORM,[doc] JNI Cannot Find Java Routines with RCP,"Hopefully this has been submitted in the right place and with the
right priority.  (It is a stopper for me.)

I have an RCP application that uses SWT and a JNI package of my own.
I also have a stand-alone SWT version that does essentially the same
thing.  In both of these the JNI part can be replaced with a pure
Java implementation.  Apart from a switch that uses the full Java
version or not they all use the same package.  The JNI implementation
is old code that has been working for some time both in and out of
Eclipse.  All of these versions work except the RCP application using
JNI.  That is it is not a bug in the package nor in making the RCP
product.

The RCP JNI version fails eventually giving an exception because the
C routine FindClass in the following C++ code returns null:

extern C {
  static int theMessageCallback(const char* pFormat va_list args) {
    jobject callback= (jobject) epicsThreadPrivateGet(messageCallbackID)
    if (callback==NULL) return ECA_NORMAL
    JNIEnv* env

    _jvm->AttachCurrentThread((void**)

    char buf[1024]
    sprintf(buf pFormat args)
    jstring msg= env->NewStringUTF(buf)

    jclass clazz = env->FindClass(gov/aps/jca/jni/JNIContextMessageCallback)

    jmethodID methodID = env->GetMethodID(clazz fire
      (Ljava/lang/String)V)
    env->CallVoidMethod(callback methodID  msg)
    _jvm->DetachCurrentThread()
    return ECA_NORMAL
  }
}

This is a C callback and the idea is to call the Java callback with
the string from the arguments.  (The problem is that clazz is null.
env is not null.)  The callback gets called from code in another DLL
that is independent of the JNI wrappers.  That library knows nothing
about Java and the callback prototype doesn't have an env as an
argument.  It calls the Java routine that will handle the callback in
Java getting the env from the thread.  This is different from what is
more commonly done which is to have a C implementation of a Java
class that gets passed the env which (indirectly) knows about the
class.

The reason it fails is that the C function FindClass which is purely
J2SDK not Eclipse uses the classpath to find the class.  With an RCP
application Eclipse apparently uses /startup.jar as the
classpath.  This is determined by printing out java.class.path from
the running app.  startup.jar has very little in it and little if
anything that is specific to the particular RCP app.  Consequently
FindClass does not find the class in this case (because it is not in
the classpath).  The RCP app does find the other classes in whatever
manner Eclipse uses to locate jars in plug-ins presumably using its
own classloaders.  It works OK until the above C callback gets called.

The reason it works standalone (not a plug-in in an RCP app) is that I
specify the classpath specifically to include that jar and FindClass
uses that classpath and finds it.  (The reason it works with the pure
Java version is that FindClass is not used.)

I was unable to get the RCP app to use my classpath for instance by
specifying it in vmargs or myapp.ini.  Eclipse apparently *overwrites*
the classpath with the above.  I would consider this also to be a bug.
It should append or use what is specified on the command line (which
could include startup.jar).

I can make it work by manually putting the package in startup.jar.
This allows FindClass to locate it in the classpath (while Eclipse
apparently finds it in the plugin directory since the jar files are
really in another plug-in).  This is not a good solution
(if for no other reason than that the class is in two places now) but
it demonstrates the problem which seems to be that FindClass does not
work in the Eclipse environment when called from C or C++ code that is
not directly part of the native implementation of a Java method and
that the reason is because the J2SDK FindClass cannot find the class
as Eclipse can.

This is a stopper for me.  It is a reasonable and straightforward
thing to do.  I think it is an oversight in the Eclipse
implementation.

I cannot change the implementation as it is not my code.  In
addition it is a correct JNI implementation.

I apologize for this being long.  The problem is somewhat deep and
hard to easily understand.  I would be happy to elucidate if
necessary.",sonia_dimitrov,evans,fixed,1,resolved,4,2011-01-03,0,23,2006-06-01,127,normal,2

inconsistent with the datapool editor.
The datapool editor uses the terms:
Delete (Equivalence Class/Variable/Record) where the UI guidelines would 
suggest using Remove since it is a object within the datapool resource.


Eclipse Guideline included below:
For consistency any command which has a similar behavior to existing commands 
in the workbench should adopt the same terminology. 

When creating a resource the term New should be used in an command or 
wizard.  For instance New File New Project and New Java Class.  The 
term Delete should be used when deleting an existing resource. 

When creating an object inside a resource (e.g. a tag in an XML file a 
method or field in a Java class) the term Add should be used the user is 
adding something to an existing resource. 

Guideline 3.3

Immediate fix I believe is to touch the jdt feature to make sure it increments. 

The root problem may have been the exact timing of the pde.build commit ... not sure ... but since it was committed shortly after the 11:00 build it may not have appeared to be the latest change?

However when I visit the navigator I see both the minified navigate-table.js and the unminified globalCommands.js are fetched from the server. Therefore we are fetching these bits twice. The same occurs when loading the editor. This is because there are plugins on the page that load globalCommands.js. This is just an example - there are various other scripts that we are effectively loading multiple times.

Some possible solutions to this duplication:

- Allow plugins to request certain services from the host framework so they don't need to be loaded independently by the plugin's iFrame
- Don't bother minifying JS files that are used by any plugin on that page.
- Maybe these plugins shouldn't be accessing scripts like globalCommands.js in the first place.",simon_kaegi,john.arthorne,fixed,1,resolved,4,2011-09-01,0,6,2011-06-09,86,normal,2

It would be preferable simply to install a newer version of the integration build on top of a stable build via the update mechanism.
Therefore I would like to ask for a change of the name of the build:
from ${buildType}${buildTime} to ${buildTime}-${buildType} so that the S or I appears only at the end and the new date/time is recognized from the comparison first.

This dependency is fragile and will lead to incorrect behaviour.  There is no guarantee that clients of the Transaction API will use Boolean.TRUE instead of some distinct true-valued Boolean instance.  Indeed in a Java 5.0-based client application autoboxing of primitive boolean values can be expected to produce distinct Booleans (at least it seems to in the IBM implementation).

The isWriteTransactionInProgress(...) method has the following check:

    Object unprotectedMode = transaction.getOptions().get(Transaction.OPTION_UNPROTECTED)

This was always the intent and I'm opening this bug to make sure we better track and plan this support.

At the moment preferences is depending on orion/auth because of the UserPreferencesProvider. The simplest solution is to factor the provider implementations right out of preferences.js however I think we also need to think about a more general authentication notification mechanism. ...something that let's us still pop open dialogs and get a retry to happen when it makes sense  while not tying itself to UI.",simon_kaegi,simon_kaegi,fixed,1,resolved,4,2012-06-08,0,2,2012-06-08,233,normal,2

The implementation of org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.util.XExpressionHelper.isLiteral(XExpression) is based on the value yielded by expr.eClass().getClassifierID(). 

This value is unique within an EPackage but not within a language: I have e.g. a language that extends XBase and adds an

XGuardExpression returns xbase::XExpression : ... 

that gets the classifier ID 13 i.e. the same as XSTRING_LITERAL in Xbase. As a consequence this rule is considered as being a Literal by XExpressionHelper.

This can have various consequences depending on the usage of this helper function. In my particular case I have introduced XGuardExpression as part of a XBlockExpression and thus the validation rule 

	@Check
	public void checkInnerExpressions(XBlockExpression block) {
		for (int i = 0 i < block.getExpressions().size() - 1 ++i) {
			XExpression expr = block.getExpressions().get(i)
			if (expressionHelper.isLiteral(expr)) {
				error(Literals can only appear as the last element of a block expression expr null
						ValidationMessageAcceptor.INSIGNIFICANT_INDEX INVALID_INNER_EXPRESSION)
			}
		}
	}

fails each time it encounters a XGuardExpression.

PLATFORM-284093,2009-07-21,Releng,PLATFORM,File corruption on the official Eclipse Update Site,"The org.eclipse.pde.core_3.5.0.v20090602.jar.pack.gz found on the http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/3.5 update site is corrupt.

I discovered this when setting up a target platform using the new Software Site type from the update site at http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/3.5. The progress bar show how the org.eclipse.pde.core_3.5.0.v20090602.jar.pack.gz being downloaded again and again. Seemingly from every conceivable mirror. This takes forever (more then an hour) but finally it does seem to succeed.

There where no errors in the log so I used the Galileo builder in a mode where it attempts an unpack on all .pack.gz files and instructed it to mirror this site. That revealed that the download fails when it tries to unpack the org.eclipse.pde.core_3.5.0.v20090602.jar.pack.gz bundle (exception below).

Although an install from the update site will be OK (P2 defaults to the unpacked version when this happens) this is a serious problem. Not only does it affect the performance when setting up a Software Site target platform in a negative way it also prevents a verified aggregation using the Galileo builder. That is currently a blocking issue for one of our customers.

Projects must use jar'ed plug-ins (with unpack=false) unless authorized by the planning council for technical reasons. Nested jars should be avoided if possible since it creates problems for projects that has dependencies to such plug-ins. The OSGi runtime is fine with it but the compiler is not able to handle classpaths that contain nested jars. In case only one nested jar exists it is often better to expand the contents of that jar into the root folder (i.e. unnest the jar).

TMF-354600,2011-08-12,Xtext,TMF,DeltaConverter produces incorrect NameBasedEObjectDescriptions for nested types,"Build Identifier: I20110613-1736

For nested types the DeltaConverter produces NameBasedEObjectDescriptions with incorrect QualifiedNames. 

Namely for a given nested type its QualifiedName as reported by DeltaConverter will be different from its QualifiedName as seen by scope provider. For example for nested type 'example.Foo.Bar' the DeltaConverter will report its name as [example][Foo][Bar] while the scope provider treats it as [example][Foo$Bar].

It follows that the 'importedNames' corresponding to the referred nested types in a resource description will never match the 'exported names' of those same types as reported by DeltaConverter. Therefore in certain cases the set of resources affected by Java changes may not be computed correctly which will result in (incremental) build problems being incorrectly reported.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Import the attached 'org.xtext.example.domainmodel' and ''org.xtext.example.domainmodel.ui' projects into the workspace

2. Run the runtime workbench and import the attached 'example' project into the runtime workspace. Note the build problem Couldn't resolve reference to JvmType 'example.Foo$Baz' in Foo.dmodel

that calling this method can take awhile to complete the first time it

The Dali team may not run into this as much since in my case we are calling this method outside of the Java editor from an external wizard so it may be a different code path.  But the delay can be pretty noticeable to the user in our wizard case.  It doesn't really seem to be an issue of priming the Dali plugins since it happens on each project.

CDT-78678,2004-11-15,cdt-core,CDT,Indexer stops reindexing file after repeated saves,"When you repeatedly modify and save the same file quickly you eventually get
stale index data.  Basically after a certain point the indexer just ignores
requests and the file never gets reindexed.  I had to shutdown & restart eclipse
(closing/opening project didn't help) to get back the normal behaviour. 

It's easier if you start with a clean workspace or make sure you close all open
projects in your workspace.  This is to avoid filling the type cache with extra
symbols we're not interested in.

1. Create a new project (I used standard make C Project).

2. Create a file test.c with simple contents eg:

struct aa {
   int x
}

Note: don't bother with any includes above since this will add extra symbols we
don't care about right now.

3. Open the C/C++ Browsing perspective.

4. Select your project in the Projects view and (global) in the Namespaces
view.  You should see aa in the Types view.

5. Double-click the aa to open the file in the editor.

6. Now change the aa to ab and save the file.  You should see ab show up
in the Types view.

7. Repeat #6 changing the name to ac ad ae etc. and always saving
immediately after.  Do this rapidly and keep incrementing the sequence.

8. Eventually the type name will be stuck and will not be in sync with your
last edit of the file.

You can see what symbols are being picked up from the index by setting a
breakpoint in the IndexerTypesJob.addType(..) method.  When the indexer stops
updating you will see stale data here.

You can see where the index requests are being queued by setting a breakpoint in
IndexManager.addSource() after the jobSet.add(..).",gheorghe,cwiebe,fixed,1,resolved,4,2004-11-18,0,2,2004-11-18,3,normal,2

There is an easy workaround:
The superfluous  log import could be properly overwritten

EMF commands don't accept null labels since Eclipse 3.5. SetPropertyCommand can either have a client label or if there is no specified label it assumes the name of the changed property. The check that determines whether label for the command is specified is outdated. It checks for null instead of empty string.
I suggest to check for both null and empty string.

To reproduce try switching shape fill/line color from the toolbar not the properties view.",aboyko,aboyko,fixed,1,resolved,4,2010-07-16,0,4,2010-02-10,0,normal,2

The above sentece is divided to 2 parts and it is ok for English.
But for Korean these 2 sentences need to be switched to translate it correctly. Actually it is not possible to translate this sentence correctly when it is devided. We need the whole strings to avoid this problem. Thank you!

Hi
Same request from T.Chinese. It should be combined together so that we can translate it and reverse the sequence of these two sentences.

TMF-401527,2013-02-22,Xtext,TMF,[trace] ITraceInformation must not require IStorage for .java files,"The method
ITraceInformation.getTraceToSource(IStorage)
assumes that there is an IStorage for a derivedResource which typically is a .java file.

However when dealing with JARed files there are only IStorage-instances for non-Java-resources.

The impact is that trace files can not be loaded for JARed .java files. 

Possible solution 1:
introduce IJdtTraceInformation.getTraceToSource(ITypeRoot)

A TypeRoot represents an IClassFile or ICompilationUnit.

Possible solution 2:
ITraceInformation.getTraceToSource(IProject project URI javaFile)
this avoids the necessity of having an IStorage for .java files.

Possible solution 3:
Provide our own IStorage implementation for .java files. The interface is not so complex. Our IStorage2URIMapper would be affected too.

This breaks adopters such as OEPE that depend on this variable to filter out inappropriate library providers and there doesn't appear to be a suitable replacement. 

Using validation to block the use of inappropriate library provider would have a significant impact on usability as the user would be presented with a number of library providers (many of which are invalid for the config) and it is possible that the library provider with highest priority (the one that gets selected by default) ends up not validating.

Here is how OEPE defines JPA library providers:

the /* line) and delete that blank first line it still
works.

Hm...with further play you can actually type lots of characters and multiple

as you delete a character (backspace) or use an arrow key to
go back a character or up a line it then seems to
start working.

ORION-390356,2012-09-25,Client,ORION,command service is not a service at all,"This has been bugging me for awhile but I've not written a bug for it before now.  When we first started with Orion we were influenced by the notion of shell services twenty things eclipse application services.  Thus things that had been called out as pluggable dependencies in eclipse were deemed services in Orion.

As Orion has evolved it's clear that the command service who's main job is keep track of what commands are available/enabled and to render them in standard ways is really not a service at all.  There's no notion of someone plugging in a different one there are no service extensions defined plug-ins do not implement one etc.

In fact this makes use of the command service awkward because all calls have to deal with the asynchronous aspect of commands.

In fact we already have a problem where some code assumes that the command service is an in-page object vs. a service (see bug 337740 comment 10).

I spoke to Simon about this and he agrees that the command service is just a utility object vs. a service.

Post 1.0 I'd like to fix this.

cc'ing Mark...I seem to remember there was some crazy workaround in one of the sites pages that had to deal with the fact that the command service was asynchronous.  Mark do you remember what that was?",susan,susan,fixed,1,resolved,4,2013-03-11,0,7,2013-03-11,167,normal,2

Problem 1: The binding displays as `^ + P` for me which is not the key I typed. The ^ means Ctrl not Command.

Possibly related: I've configured OS X to map the left Alt key on my US PC keyboard to Command. So when I'm typing this key binding I'm actually pressing Left Alt + P to enter ⌘ + P.)

TMF-313938,2010-05-21,Xtext,TMF,bracket matching fails to match in many cases,"Hi
the automatic bracket matching (i.e. matching bracket being highlighted)
only works for me in some situations.

As an example - in this b3 text:

repository svn MyRepo { connection : http://abc.org }
resolution {
select-first {
repository MyRepo { path : /features  }
}
}

the matching does not work for the outermost brackets.
(In fact this part was the only part where it actually managed to match
brackets).

Wonders if the bracket matching is done with aid from the grammar and that the problems occur because of backtracking...

Seems like the matching of brackets should be done at the lexical level so should not really be affected by a complicated grammar.

The matching also breaks if there are syntax errors:
Here matching works (using | to highlight what it matches and what I expect:
  select-first {
    repository  MyRepo {| path : features  }|
  }

But not here:
  select-first {|
    repository  MyRepo  path : features  }|
  }

I assume it is supposed to really show the lexical matching as this is very useful when there are matching errors.

Problem can be observed with latest b3 and input like:
function foo() { }",tmf.xtext-inbox,henrik.lindberg,fixed,1,closed,6,2017-09-19,0,5,2010-09-03,105,normal,2

file name so that multple log files of the same type can be imported.  This 
functionality does not work for certain regular expressions.  For example if 
the user specifies the file name as:

C:\Logs\myapp\d*.log

where the file name regular expression is meant to be myapp\d*.log the import 
operation will return an error indicating the file could not be found.  The log 
import code is interpreting the file name as d*.log and the path as 
C:\Logs\myapp.  The backslash in the regular expression is interpretted as a 
path separator character.

To fix this the regular expression can be specified surrounded by double 
quotes:

C:\Logs\myapp\d*.log

to prevent the ambiguity.  The log import code needs to be changed to process 
the double quotes as a regular expression.

Also the documentation needs to be changed to encourage users to specify 
regular expressions in double quotes.",smith,smith,fixed,1,closed,6,2012-02-15,0,5,2005-04-20,5,normal,2

And I think those two items are related.

First some cases:
1) I create my Orion-based app which consumes just a small set of Orion libs and UIs. I would like to have an easy way to pull what I need create my own drop and then keep it in sync with the latest Orion.
2) I would like to consume just the Orion editor. 
3) I would like to deploy Orion client code on Tomcat or run as node.js no OSGi see the node.js work from Mark

I would like to make work on this cases easier.

What I think would help is:
1) Orion projects should not be Eclipse plug-ins
2) To run such Orion code on Equinox we would need a special Eclipse plug-in that handles Jetty mappings
3) To run in other evns (Tomcat node.js) we would just need to create mappings (right now you need to ripped off the code from Eclipse plug-ins first)
4) At first I thought we should put all the client code into one repo but now I think we should make a repo per each micro-service we have (registry plugins commands etc. maybe the editor) and put the rest into one repo. I would also try to decouple auth and make it a separate framework.

I investigated the problem found that in 
AbstractDocumentProvider::saveDocument it try to save without checking if 
this new document is already opened or not. 


I added the following check to saveDocument which fix the problem.

Object obj=null
String newPath = element.toString()
String filePath = null

for (Iterator i = getConnectedElements()i.hasNext()) {
  obj = i.next()
  filePath = obj.toString()

The C99 spec specifically disallows this practice. 

However it makes sense for the C99 parser to be lenient and accept it. One argument is that gcc accepts implicit int when run in -std=c99 mode (a warning is issued). Also some of the UPC test cases I have make use of implicit int even though it doesn't conform to the spec.

See the the grammar below. In case the feature 'referenceType' is set to its default (none) it should not get serialized. But serializing a type results e.g. in:

This cannot be avoided using a customized ITransientValueService (but the default implementation already marks feature with default value as transient).

Eclipse root build.xml that points to contributed launcher directory without '.'

Build ID: I20071213-1700

Steps To Reproduce:
1.  Build Eclipse from source for a distribution that requires recompilation of the eclipse launcher (e.g. ./build -os solaris -ws gtk -arch x86 -compilelibs)
2.  The contributed launcher files will be copied to /features/org.eclipse.equinox.executable/contributed/gtk/solaris/.x86/
3.  If you look at the readme.txt in /features/org.eclipse.equinox.executable/contributed/gtk/solaris/x86/ you will see that the eclipse launcher files should have been copied to that directory.
4.  This holds for gtk-linux-s390 and s390x as well.


More information:
It appears that between 3.3.0 and 3.4M4 the location of the recompiled launcher files changed (orginally I think these were in /build_base/launchertmp) and perhaps this added extra period was a typo.  I will attach the modified main build.xml that resolves this problem -- unfortunately I could not locate the root build.xml in the source repository or I would also provide the path to it.

The specific problem in the build.xml (as of the 3.4M4 source distribution is on line 103).  I believe this line should read

ORION-443151,2014-09-02,Client,ORION,Remove plugin-based i18n?,"Orion's current story for i18n relies on the plugin registry to contribute translations [1]. This has some advantages but they are outweighed by the downsides:

 - Complex hard for developers to understand
 - Service APIs are polluted with i18n-related properties: descriptionKey nameKey etc
 - Limitations: for example we can't translate the login page [2]
 - Scatters a cross-cutting concern (loading message bundle) through the codebase [3]

It would be preferable to rely only on the RequireJS i18n plugin and allow any module (both plugins and pages) to load i18n! modules directly.

Opening this bug for discussion. In particular we'd need to determine how to ship translations that are not plugin-based and what sort of build-time changes would be needed.



[1] https://wiki.eclipse.org/Orion/Internationalization
[2] See bug 400637
[3] When dealing with translated plugins we cannot rely on the AMD loader to fetch the required bundles during normal dependency resolution since the set of required bundles is unknown until other service data is fetched typically deep into the UI code. This has caused #getMessageBundle() calls to infest many UI widgets sometimes forcing async functions into interfaces where they do not belong just to enable translation.

By relying purely on the loader we can handle message bundles like any other AMD dependency across the codebase.",libingw,mamacdon,fixed,1,resolved,4,2015-10-05,0,3,2015-08-25,357,normal,2

There is no need to do a second pass since the creation context element (the owner) has alrady being calculated during the first pass and of cause it is costly.

CDT-181021,2007-04-04,cdt-core,CDT,[Project Model]Source location and exlude from build settings are inconsistent,"A reply to the dev list from Sascha Radike:

>>--- What exactly is the difference between setting up source folders
(source
Locations) source location exclusion filters and excluding resources from
built (resource properties)?
[Mikhail] These settings should be consistent with each other so there
should be no difference between them. Please raise a bug if you see any
inconsistency.

Why is it possible to exclude resources from build which are not within a
source build path ?
[Mikhail] Could you create a bug for this describing steps to reproduce?


[[Sascha]] I'm not exactly sure which bug to post because I'm not really
sure how the source location and resource exclusion work together.

Example A:
The place to edit source locations is C/C++ project paths and symbols /
Source location.
The place to exclude folders/files is the C/C++ Build Settings / [x]
Exclude from build.

I have a project like this:

Project
	SourceFolder
		aSrcFile.c
	NonSourceFolder
		aNonSrcFile.c


SourceFolder is a source location. What will happen when I add the exclusion
filter * to this source location? Will a folders/files below SourceFolder
be excluded? This won't affect the Exclude from build option. This option
has not been set for folder SourceFolder.

Oh...just after setting Exclude from build and then removing the option
for SourceFolder the folder now appears...non-sourcerish (only-border C
icon). Changing source location exclusion settings don't seem to take effect
instantly.

Well the question is: How exactly do those two kinds of exclusion
(exclusion filter and resource exclude form build option) work together ?
The first one will show the empty-only-border-C icon the second one will
put a line across the icon.


Example B:

Same project layout as above. SourceFolder is a source location again. But I
can still set the [x] Exclude from build option for NonSourceFolder and
aNonSrcFile.c. Both files are excluded anyway because they are not on the
build path.

So..I'm confuded. I'm not sure what's a bug and what's a feature I just
don't understand )",mikhail.sennikovskiy,mikhail.sennikovskiy,fixed,1,resolved,4,2007-04-12,0,4,2007-04-10,6,normal,2

GMF-RUNTIME-276511,2009-05-15,General,GMF-RUNTIME,Infinite loop caused by rounding error in RelativeToBorderLocator,"Looks like following code in RelativeToBorderLocator.relocate(IFigure target) works incorrectly for zoom values different from 1:

Rectangle bounds = reference instanceof HandleBounds ? ((HandleBounds) reference).getHandleBounds().getCopy() : reference.getBounds().getCopy()	

reference.translateToAbsolute(bounds)
target.translateToRelative(bounds)

as a result bounds rectanlge will be translated first to absolute coordinates and then to a relative coordinates. 

In case both figures (reference and target) are enclosed into the ScalableFreeformLayeredPane figure (default figure used for displaying diagrams) then called ScalableFreeformLayeredPane.translateToParent()/.translateFromParent() will introduce unwanted rounding error (see Rectangle.performScale() implementaton). My suggestion is: do not translate bounds to absolute coordinates and back here but rather translate bounds to common parent figure and then back. Since common parent figure is ScalableFreeformLayeredPane in this case coordinates will not be scaled so there will be no rounding errors.

Way to show up this problem:
1. generate diagram (ecore example diagram) with validationEnabled=true  validationDecorators=true liveValidationUIFeedback=true GenDiagram options switched on.
2. Create new instance of this diagram introduce any validation errors associated with diagram element (in case of ecore diagram - set the name of the package represented on diagram to null).
3. Validate diagram -> error validation decorator will be added to the diagram figure and attached to the top-right diagram element corner.
4. Ensure animated zoom is enabled in diagram options.
5. Zoom in diagram editor.

As a result diagram editor will enter infinite loop. The reason of this loop is:

reference.translateToAbsolute(bounds)
target.translateToRelative(bounds)

calls will always increate the width of bounds object by 1 (as a result of rounding error) then decorator will be repositioned into the properly calculated place as a result the size of diagram will be recalculated and increased by 1.

Z_ARCHIVED-66323,2004-06-09,Hyades,Z_ARCHIVED,Launch Configuration: Need to address ResourceSet issues,"Currently the AbstractLaunchConfigurationDelegate provided with Hyades makes
the implicit requirement that getLaunchedElement() returns an EMF object from a
private Resource Set instead of using the EMF object returned by the
LaunchConfigurationFacade (which belongs to the same resource set as the one
used by the Launch Configuration tabs i.e. the Test Navigator's Resource Set).
This is a problem however since each caller to getLaunchedElement() may end up
with a different copy of it each copy in a separate ResourceSet.
There should a be a more general solution to this problem.
In my opinion the best solution would consist in the following changes:
- have the LaunchConfigurationFacade's EMF methods take an additional
ResourceSet parameter. Any more high-level methods that invoke these methods
should also take this additional parameter.
- add a getPrivateResourceSet() to AbstractLaunchConfigurationDelegate that
returns a unique ResourceSet for each launch but returns the same one within
one launch.
- modify the IRunHandler interface so that it takes the Delegate's private
ResourceSet. This resource set could be used for retrieving information from the
LaunchConfiguration using the LaunchConfigurationFacade classes.",dguilbaud,julien.canches,fixed,1,closed,6,2012-02-15,0,4,2004-08-20,72,minor,2

Importing a log file from a remote z/OS system may result in incomplete data

Importing a log file using Log and Trace Analyzer from a remote z/OS system may 
result in incomplete data shown in the Log View.  The import operation may stop 
prematurely and not all of the log records are shown in the Log View.  This 
problem occurs when one of the following IBM JDK versions is installed on the 
z/OS system:

1.4.1 PTF UQ88783
1.4.2 PTF UQ90449
1.4.2 PTF UQ93743

To work around this problem change the configuration of the Hyades Agent 
Controller on the z/OS system by doing the following:

1) Edit the file 
plugins/org.eclipse.hyades.logging.parsers/config/pluginconfig.xml in the Agent 
Controller install directory.
2) Add a new Parameter to the RemoteLogParserLoader Application element after 
the java.version parameter.  For example:

- Nightly builds run from master branch. No tagging is done. I think the builder stay unchanged here. It will continue to hammer the map files to point to master rather than the tags in the maps.

- Integration builds run from integration branch. The builder tags all repositories and updates the map files for any bundles that have changed. I believe the builder itself doesn't need changes here but we need an extra step in the bootstrap script to perform the tagging.

On logistics the question is how it fits into the current priority list:

1) Git migration
2) Conversion of Eclipse 4 to full builder
3) Moving build to eclipse.org.

I currently see this as part of 2). There's not a lot of value in switching 3.x development to a two-branch model because soon we won't be doing 3.x nightly builds anymore.

I wanted to mention a deadlock situation that I came across. I'm not sure yet if it's something completely silly that I've done that wouldn't show up in a normal use case but here are the stacks.

I think I can solve the issue for my usage but I thought I'd point it out for when you are looking at the SimpleCache implementation again -- I see you have a TODO mark there.

our (Code Recommenders) integration builds consume [1] to sanity-check whether we still compile fine against Mylyn. Unfortunately the weekly snapshot composite repository is empty at the moment.

Intuitively I would say that a weekly or nightly repository should never be empty but maybe that's a misconception on my part... Would you advise against consuming your weekly in our sanity builds?

We don't really have a formal scope for commands that are in visual panes within a page and we have some item level commands that don't appear in navigators so they are hard to find.

When first defining scopes I avoided the temptation to define viewlet level command scopes (and associated toolbars) until we had concrete instances.  Now we have several pages with a viewlet scope.

Issues include:
- is there a common area (visual) to show these kinds of commands?
- are they buttons icons or links (if links they should be styled differently from normal links)
- how can we style these areas so the scope is clear without coming up with a heavy viewlet treatment?  

Examples of places we have visual area commands
- the add favorites icon
- the git status push fetch merge buttons
- side by side compare panes

The favorites pane got some visual design attention from Linda for viewlet styling that is where the heavy font and dotted underline came from.  But the add favorite command is hard to find if the pane isn't wide.

However the ContentTypeRegistry does not recognize any file (eg foo.d.ts) as having the type given above. To determine a file extension it examines the segment following the final . so 
> extension(foo.d.ts) == ts
even if no content type actually registers ts anywhere.

The algorithm should be changed to consult the available extensions as follows
- Take the suffix of filename starting from the initial .
- Check registry for a contentType with matching extension
- If no match pop off the leading dot-segment and repeat previous step
- If no more segments return null

This will cause longer extensions to match first so if both extensions ts and d.ts are registered to separate content types we obtain

The problem is that ImageFileDropTargetListener always assumes that data hasn't been transferred which means that this drop target listener is always enabled.

Is it possible to make these protected rather than private? Otherwise I cannot easily override or use the features of this abstract class easily.

I'm still working through it but so far my problems are:

field uieProperties is private. There is a public getter method but no setter. Can you make this field protected or provided a protected setter method so I can set it. It gets set in findPlatforms but that's also private.

The method findPlatforms is private meaning I cannot subclass or call in my subclass.

I haven't gotten there yet but I anticipate the createDeviceProfiles createDeviceConfigurations and createServiceApis methods will also be a problem because they are private.

Z_ARCHIVED-45470,2003-10-23,Hyades,Z_ARCHIVED,PDSecurity causes javacore,"This defect occured when the WSDK were doing their testing on Linux (SuSE 8.1) 
machine details are 1.8GHz with 2GB RAM.  We saw more than one occurence of 
this problem
although we were unable to consistently recreate it.  The javacore when it did 
happen was always during the shutdown of Eclipse.

This isn't going to be easy to describe but please bear with me!

I'll forward the javacore dump to Jeff Turnham for completeness the file is 
called javacore1921.1063369006.txt (I'll refer to line numbers in this file to 
try to make things easier.)

Line 752 shows PDSecurityPlugin.shutdown method being called which in turn 
(from the code) calls PDSecurityImages.shutdown() method.

PDSecurityImages.shutdown() initially checks to see if _images has been 
initialised and if not returns immediately.  The implementation of this class 
appears to be the source of
the problem.  In order for this method to do anything the class must be 
instantiated.  During the initialisation of the class (lines 45 and 46) two 
final static ImageDescriptors are
instantiated each making a call to createManaged(String String).  Inside 
createManaged method you will see that _images gets initialised with a new 
HashMap() if it is null.

Therefore _image can 'never' be null during shutdown().

The createManaged(String String) method also initialises an ImageDescriptor 
from a URL.  You will see all this from the javacore round lines 751 back up to 
745 where it looks like
the code is trying to get hold of a graphic device which by now probably 
doesn't exist (Eclipse is shutting down).

I hope this makes sense I guess you'll need to get back to me if it doesn't.

Hi Valentina...is this CMVC component still valid?
If so can you take a look at this defect?  Andy sent 
me the javacore file and I've pasted the stack below.
It appears that an during the creation of an Image 
the JVM is crashing (perhaps due to an image already
being disposed?)

Thanks...

1) XML parsing of the adapter file failed because of the incorrect encoding.  
We currently package the adapter file as a text file on z/OS so to read it with 
the SAX parser the encoding specifed in the file needs to be IBM-1047.  

2) The StaticParserWrapper class updates the adapter configuration with 
properties specified by the user on the UI and then saves the configuration in 
a new temporary adapter file.  When it saves the configuration currently it 
saves it as a text file with the default UTF-8 encoding.  The adapter running 
on z/OS can't parse the new adapter file because of its incorrect encoding.

There are two solutions for problem 1)
a) have a separate set of adapter files for z/OS with IBM-1047 encoding - (Pro: 
user can easily modify the files on z/.OS    Con: extra work required in terms 
of maintenance and packaging)
b) package the adapter files as binary on z/OS  (Pro: one set of adapter files 
for all platforms  Con: user cannot easily modify the adaptor files)

CDT-95641,2005-05-17,cdt-core,CDT,[Scanner Config] Per file scanner info not available for header files and not compiled source files,"Per file SCD will discover file specific scanner info only for built source
files. Include files per se and source files that are not built will not have
any discovered scanner info associated.

For Indexer client this situation is more or less OK header files are allways
parsed in context of some source file while not compiled source files are not
indexed. However there are other parser clients that require parsing of header
files on their own. This parsing is bound to fail (create a load of problems)
since there is no scanner info to be used during the parse. Parsing stand alone
header files has other chalanges as well: which language dialect to use C or
C++ which built-in scanner info to use C or C++ etc.

There are several solutions to the problem unfortunately all decrease parsing
correctness:

1. Use only compiler internal scanner info assume language dialect of the
project nature.
2. Use project scanner info (equal to sum of all scanner info for all source
files) assume language dialect of the project nature.
3. Try to figure out which source files include respective header file and use
scanner info associated with one of them. - This seems to be too expensive
operation - requires accessing the index if it exists.

From my chair it looks like we are better of with option 2 which effectively
reduces parsing correctness to the same level we have with per project scanner info.

TMF-354103,2011-08-08,Xtext,TMF,JRE_CONTAINER optimization in JdtToBeBuiltComputer,"Build Identifier: I20110613-1736

JdtToBeBuiltComputer tries to optimize away costly traversing of JRE_CONTAINER. Unfortunately the current implementation based on equality with 'org.eclipse.jdt.launching.JRE_CONTAINER' does not always work. The raw classpath entry for JRE_CONTAINER can just as well look as 'org.eclipse.jdt.launching.JRE_CONTAINER/org.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.ui.launcher.StandardVMType/JavaSE-1.6'  in which case the optimization is not working which can slow down things considerably.

Similar implementation is also used in JavaProjectsStateHelper.

A fix may look as root.getRawClasspathEntry().getPath().toString().startsWith(org.eclipse.jdt.launching.JRE_CONTAINER).

writing to the log file does not close the file.  One such application is the 
Apache server writing to its access log file.  Currently the GLA uses the file 
modification time to determine whether the file has changed since it reached 
the end of file.  But if the application does not close the file the 
modification time will not change.  A fix for this problem is to check the file 
size as well as the modification time.  If one of them has changed then open 
the file again and continue reading the file from the last bookmark.

Here is the code fix in the BufferedPeriodicReader.prepare() method in the 
SingleOSFileSensor class:

currentFileStat=new File(filename)
if (currentFileStat.lastModified()>lastModified || currentFileStat.length() != 
lastSize) {
	currentFile = new RandomAccessFile(filename r)

have left this out for now.

	lastModified=currentFileStat.lastModified()
	lastSize = currentFile.length()

Built-in types are used in return types and template parameters
and with adjective-like types (unsigned and long).
I can see no value in knowing which keywords can be types.

2) true and false should not be considered built-in types.

3) Preprocessor instructions (eg. #include or apparently anything

TMF-366414,2011-12-12,Xtext,TMF,Import statement doesn't work properly,"Build Identifier: 20110916-0149

I'm trying to embed xbase expressions into a xtext grammer like it's done in http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation/2_0_0/199d-xbase-expressions.php.

Unfortunately the import statement doesn't work like I expect it. I'm getting the error 'XExpression cannot by resolved to a rule' in the following grammar:

grammar org.xtext.example.mydsl.MyDsl3 with org.eclipse.xtext.common.Terminals
generate myDsl3 http://www.xtext.org/example/mydsl/MyDsl3
import http://www.eclipse.org/xtext/xbase/Xbase as xbase
Model: 'Model' body=XExpression

If I use a full qualified reference (xbase::XExpression) I get multiple syntax errors ('mismatched input ...').

Did I miss some syntax changes?

In contrast to the grammar above the following grammar works:

grammar org.xtext.example.mydsl.MyDsl3 with org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.Xbase
generate myDsl3 http://www.xtext.org/example/mydsl/MyDsl3
Model: 'Model' body=XExpression

I got following comment to this during code/scenario review:

The triple oslc:propertyDefinition should be omitted entirely.  Its presence would asserts that the subject shape contains constraints about the usage of oslc_auto:parameterDefinition in your implementation but this shape contains constraints about *your parameter* on *your Auto Plan*.  Since Automation Plan parameters are not namespace-qualified oslc:propertyDefinition is omitted for them.  There is 1 line in the Automation 2.0 spec about this -) and the currently available 2.0 examples DO have this triple but should not and I have queued a correction up in the Automation WG.

PLATFORM-390986,2012-10-02,Releng,PLATFORM,change platform names to contain accurate bits and VM Levels,"In our build/test system we use platform name in several places to form log names links etc. 

Now that I've broken it thought I'd open a bug to document all the places it touches ... though still missing something.  

a) in the vm.properties files there's a line similar to 
platform=linux.gtk.x86_6.0
that'd changed to 
platform=linux.gtk.x86_64_6.0 [to signify 64 bit]

b) the main log is piped or renamed (or created by ant?) to 
.../results/consolelogs/linux.gtk.x86_6.0_consolelog.txt changed to 
.../results/consolelogs/linux.gtk.x86_64_6.0_consolelog.txt
[this seemed to happen automatically but could not find where its done]. 

c) during the tests (via test framework) the junit results are put in 
${results}/xml/${report}_${platform}.xml [that is controlled by 'a' above]. 

d) the logs.php file has a section with lines such as 
listDegailedLogs(linux.gtk.x86_6.0)
that needs to be changed to 
listDegailedLogs(linux.gtk.x86_64_6.0)

e) the file testManifest.txt has lines such as 

changed to 

[If not done the test will show up as missing results]. 

f) after the tests are done there is a step where the summary table is created by a custom ant task that shows number of failures/errors and links to the full report.  

It is this summary step that is currently failing. 

Granted I have only just now updated the testManifest.xml file. After doing that I tried re-generating but didn't seem to work. So either the regen manual process isn't working quite right or the summary task can not handle a name with so many underscores.

Proposed Fix:

The spawner creates a new program group by calling
setpgid(getpgid() getpgid())
after the fork (has to be done before any exec.. call)
the call to kill is replaced by killpg to destroy the whole process group.

CDT-44500,2003-10-08,cdt-core,CDT,Deleting symbolic link in workspace doesn't force dependency recalculation,"I created a symbolic link which I used in my workpace path ww->workspaces/ws6

>mkdir workspaces
>mkdir workspaces/ws6
>ln -s workspaces/ws6 ww
>eclipse -data ww

The subdir.dep didn't translate it to the full path so it contains
J.o: \
/home/twolff/cdt/linux/ww/mgexe/J.h 

Then when I removed ww restarted the eclipse with the actual path in the 
workspace
 
>rm ww
>eclipse -data workspaces/ws6 

and rebuilt the project the subdir.dep still contains the ww in the path and 
the build fails with 

make: *** No rule to make target `/home/twolff/cdt/linux/ww/mgexe/J.h' needed 
by `J.o'.  Stop.

The workaround is not to remove the Release directory and rebuild but to go 
and touch ALL the cpp files which have a dependency in the subdir.dep. 

This may be connected with 44154 (saving included before including doesn't 
invoke dependency calculator)

How about a release note stating that we shouldn't use links in our workspaces 
to begin with -- as what may become of defect 43372 (cannot debug managed 
build) -- and add this reasoning as well. 

Tanya
Since the problem is in the dependency reporting and the dependencies are 
calculated on the source file not the output deleting the output won't trigger 
the re-indexing that is needed to do a correct dep analysis. I ran into 
something similar when I moved a bunch of files and had to touch them all in 
order to get a proper build.

Frankly I doubt users will care why the dependencies are coming back wrong 
they will just want to know why we didn't fix it. That said it seems like it 
may be too late to change this safely. If there is a 1.2.1 release then this 
should be something we address as critical.

TMF-352450,2011-07-19,Xtext,TMF,[Xtend] Models cannot be read by reader,"Build Identifier: 2.0.0

I Try to read some Xtend model with Mwe Reader. This does not work

Here the Workflow:

module Test

Workflow {
	
	component = org.eclipse.xtext.mwe.Reader {
		path = src
		uriFilter = org.eclipse.xtext.mwe.NameBasedFilter {
			extension = xtend
		}
		register = org.eclipse.xtext.xtend2.Xtend2StandaloneSetup {}
		loadResource = {
			slot = model
		}
	}
	
}

Having a simple model

package test

class Test {
	
}

i get
